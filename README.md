# Example workflow for forecasting smoking prevalence

This code is designed to support the analyst team to understand how to run the model - by providing a worked example of the entire workflow. This example is a forecast of smoking prevalence to 2030.   

At the moment only members of our project team are able to run this code because it depends on a number of R packages that we have developed and that are currently stored in private repos.
