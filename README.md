# Example workflow for forecasting smoking prevalence

This code is designed to support the analyst team to understand how to run the model - by providing a worked example of the entire workflow. This example is a forecast of smoking prevalence to 2030.   

The R packages that we have developed to enable the code to be run are currently available only to our project team.
